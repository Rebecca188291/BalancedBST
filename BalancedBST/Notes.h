Saturday To Do list:
1. update height after removal



Main:
	~Still need to work on parsing, allow spaces in name and allow for leading zeros.


Remove function:
	~Redo the entire thing to be recursive so that heigh can be easily updated, but double check if 
	this is ok

Parsing:
	~Allow for names with spaces
	~Allow for leading zeros

Print:
	~I need to remember to fix the print to ONLY print the names, so far they print everything!
	
removeInOrderN:
	~This is still not working, and when the main root is removed, it takes all its right stuff with it!

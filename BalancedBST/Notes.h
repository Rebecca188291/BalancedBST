/*
Insert function:
	~All have to do with the rotation function. It seems that I have the actual rotating good for the right rotation, 
	but I seem to be struggling with actually getting this->root to update to a new root. I have not yet gotten rotations working
	with something that wasn't involving the root, but that should be good now
	~Still need to have the option for leading zeros

Remove function:
	~Readjust height

Rotations:
	~See Insert

Parsing:
	~Allow for names with spaces
	~Allow for leading zeros

Print:
	~I need to remember to fix the print to ONLY print the names, so far they print everything!
	
removeInOrderN:
	~This is still not working, and when the main root is removed, it takes all its right stuff with it!

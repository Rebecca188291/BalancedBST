TO DO:
1. fix removeInOrderN
2. Fix parsing
4. fix printing
5. DEBUG

Main:
	~Still need to work on parsing, allow spaces in name and allow for leading zeros

Parsing:
	~Allow for names with spaces
	~Allow for leading zeros

Print:
	~I need to remember to fix the print to ONLY print the names, so far they print everything!
	
removeInOrderN:
	~This is still not working, and when the main root is removed, it takes all its right stuff with it!
